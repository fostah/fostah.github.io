In the time it takes you to read this post, you could easily integrate comments into a site generated by [Jekyll][jekyll_link]. [Disqus][disqus_link] makes it that easy. Is it the best solution? I can't answer that. There might even be an easier solution, though my initial research, and my experience thus far, makes that hard for me to believe. All that matters is it took me no more than ten minutes to get setup, and brought a ton of value to my site. The comment related functionality that it provides -- commenting, like / dislike, subscribing via email and RSS -- is way beyond anything that I would be willing to integrate myself. It's a really nice utility, and they did a great job making it easy for sites to adopt it, which should always be priority number one if you're trying to grow a community.

With that, here's all you have to do to get your site setup... Actually, just read [this blog post from Eric Tang][tang_link]. There's better uses for my time than covering something that someone else has already documented so well.
