I added [Google Analytics][ga_link] to the site today, with the goal of confirming with solid statistical data how few viewers of these pages there actually are.

As with anything that I add to the site, mainly because I won't bother otherwise, it was super easy to integrate with my Jekyll project. After signing up with Google Analytics, and creating an account of fostah.com, it was just a matter of navigating to the Admin section and pasting the code provided in the Tracking Code tab to the header of my base.html layout file. I chose to go with the Standard tracking code.

That's all there is to it, another piece of presumed value added with to little to no effort.
