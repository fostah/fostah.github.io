Over at [highslide.com][highslide_link] they have this really nice Javascript API for viewing thumbnails and other media content. It's super easy to integrate with your site and is even easier to start using, at least from this fairly seasoned software developer's perspective. 

If you click on the thumbnail of [Rebel Blood #2][rebelblood_link], you'll get an idea of how slick this viewer is, and it might even give a hint to how I plan to use it in the future.

Best of all, Highslide makes the API open and free to us nobodies, only charging those that are out to make a buck. Doens't get much better than that now, does it?
